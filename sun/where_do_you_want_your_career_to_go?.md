**Two tips from each panel member:**

* New jobs found by meeting people, not by sending in CV
* Keep on learning new skills
* Computer Assisted Reporting essential but don't forget to polish your writing skills. No one will read your investigation if it's not an enjoyable read. Go back to basics
* Be prepared to learn additional skills on evenings and weekends
* Understand the organisation you are going to work for - who are the people in the organisation that can get things done? Find a good champion for your work and listen to them
* Be willing to do the jobs that other people may not want to do - managers appreciate people who go the extra mile
* Get to know everyone on the team and try your best to make a good impression (esp when interning)
* If you are interested in learning code, you should be prepared to put in extra time outside of work
* Learn video - very important in getting a job: how do you get excel into pictures? You have to put it into pictures

**How to get unstuck when you feel stuck in a job:**

* Remain positive at all times. Don't complain. Be a builder and don't badmouth your colleagues
* Journalism isn't a 9-5, you must devote some of your own time. Your energy level and how much you want to work at this has everything to do with your success
* When learning code, don't feel disheartened! You can do it!
* Be active, not passive - have a long term vision of where you want to be and build step by step
* Use IRE tipsheets
* Be an ideas person, have imagination
* If you feel overwhelmed it's okay to take a break and figure out what is important to you
* Extra Extra blog on IRE
* Don't be afraid to brag and share your work

**How to get better at something you're not good at:**

* Don't forget to keep on working on the things you have learned here otherwise you will forget
* Do the hard things, don't stick to the stuff you feel confident in
* Don't try to teach yourself everything at once. Don't try to learn an entire system, start small and build on the previous project eg. bar chart using html, static then move towards dynamic next time
* Work on your networking skills
