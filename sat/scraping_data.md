### Scraping data

**When to scrape:**

*When no one has the data you need*

* Eg to answer the question - how many adoptions have taken place internationally where the children are subsequently rehomed. Scraping a messageboard
* Down them all - download manager, plugin for FF
	
*When they won't give you the data you need and you don't have time for FOIA*

* The Second Mile - child abuse case. Database of Penn. state police - sex offenders register
* Firebug - get under the hood of the website. Chrome in network tab, run search on the website. 'POST' request to the server, parameters that it is feeding to the servers
* Used free tool called 'ie unit' - quick focus interface as you navigate through the page it goes into the page and figures out what js is running as you click through. Write script then run it and it will download the data
* Helium scraper - basic version of software for $99. 10 day trial, point and click tool
	
*When there is no one to ask or you don't want them to know you are doing it*

* Counterfeit pharma coming out of China
	
*When you want regular updates*

* Crime numbers - good for police reporters, provide context in your reporting
	
*Cautions:* 

* How do you know you got them all? 
* Look for the hidden treasure - 'download dataset' 
* Involve the lawyers, be mindful of legal implications
