###Crossing the language boundaries

* Email sucks - better to use a ticket system such as Jira

* Have developers in your editorial meeting

* Make sure you leave enough time for testing news apps

* Is it something you might want to reuse or repurpose?

* What is the absolute minimum set of things it is worth launching - minimum viable product? Can you launch more features as time goes on?

* CMS Inflexible, but inflexibility can be an opportunity as CMS rely on clear workflow - Gateway drug to programming? Key to understanding logic

* Participating in hackathons - solutions to problems: 2:1 devs to reporters
 
* Source: learning sessions - Matt Waite series on journalism ethics

* Just because it's a big story doesn't mean it should be a big application. Just because the journalist thinks the data is important, it doesn't mean it should be a big data application

* Developers should avoid pushing for unrealistic deadlines from journalists because the reporting process takes a long time

* Always remember to fact check the app!! 

* Very difficult to be a very good developer and a very good reporter simultaneously - very different types of disciplines, but good to have enough of an understanding to be able to *communicate* easily between each other

* Learning lunches - talking about things, putting in context, talk about what is and is not easy to do, easy to scrape vs hard to scrape etc. Create a space for everyone to ask questions that there is no other good time to ask - [link](github.com/veltman/learninglunches)

* Static vs dynamic:
 	* Static - Actual file sitting somewhere, pre-wrapped food for you to take
 	* Dynamic - food in a restaurant, assembled on the fly from a db becayse you asked for it, file does not actually exist


* Static site generator, benefits of a static site, but a database behind the scenes, so our users feel like they are using a vending machine. Speedier than a static site

* Workflow - a lot of backward, sideways movement on the reporting side

* Who edits data applications? Fuzzy line between reporters and developers. Reporters would love to have great interactives whilst they are writing so they could learn from them

* What can be done, should be done and what you want to do. Always remember to go back to the mission - get information to the public

* Check your metrics - why do your editors want these apps? Will people actually use them?
