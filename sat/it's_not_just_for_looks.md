BBC online workflow: 

1. Define: Getting the who, what, when, where of the projct down on paper. Figure out who has a right to an opinion, weekly checkin schedule etc. Write a headline of what you want to create
2. Brainstorm: All hands on deck, as many ideas as you can come up with, quantity not quality. Designers to understand editorial process. Journos to try not to come with a sketch of what you expect and be disappointed if it doesn't come off. No one party should dominate. Keep pushing on ideas, first idea you come up with probably not the best one. 
3. Wireframe and prototype: Test frequently and early, sanity check your ideas to make sure they make sense to people not involved in the project. Set up questions you will ask in user testing. Distil information to find out which parts are relevant. Use proto.io and paper prototypes
4. Refine and protect: Mobile first starting with the smallest screen. Conisistent, optimised user experience. Accessibility should be key
5. Deliver: More and more designer/developers at the BBC. Testing on a whole stack of devices, every browser

NYT: Work completely outside of the content management system Everything we do is collaborative 

Would describe the team as a "product development team"

Newsrooms very good at doing single pane graphics, but not so good at devising big new ways

What's the story? What's the headline?

**Oscar coverage:**

Old model:

* Feature creep - a huge problem. User comes to site and can't figure out what to do in the first 7 seconds

New model: 

* Get rid of all tabs - tabs are LAZY. Design becomes much cleaner 
* Twitter coverage not just on a hashtag
* Presenters referenced live blog and live blog referenced them
* Deprioritised the ballot because it was only important to a small number of users (analytics)
* Event tracker to check what readers are doing
* Do readers use the tools in the way that we expect? Answer: yes

Need to improve on accessability testing

**Planet Money makes a T-shirt**

* Eight people on the team: Two designer/developers, 3 interactive producers, project manager, journos
* Brainstorming - started with the process story, storyboarded everything
* Visual style guife for all photographers to help get a consistent look. Cheat sheet made and specified down to the lenses that would be used, technical specification
* Inspiration - Serengeti Lion project from National Geographic
* Wireframed structure - visually driven with a text and graphic component
* Broke down into chapters. How do we break this up within chapters? 
* Amazing visuals of the process so lead with video.
* Conversational voice guides you through
* Get more indepth - scripts for video and text below written mindfully of each other
* Design decisions around the interface were deliberate
* If it doesn't work on mobile it doesn't work
* No autoplaying video on mobile
* Reach out on instagram to ask people to share pictures of themselves wearing the tshirt
* User testing is so important: watched as people went through the site - significant changes occurred after this
