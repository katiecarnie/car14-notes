**Tips:**

* Consider using PHP or GBG encryption with email

* When using chat, use secure chat or [Adium](https://adium.im/) (OTR)

* Enable full disk encryption

* Keep sensitive information separate

* Power down your computer often to close connections

* Use a separate laptop and Tails - partner project that allows user to run Tor on a USB

**How does Tor work?**

Network of 5000 volunteers: 

* Alice sends an email to Bob 
* Email sent to Alice's ISP
* Goes into the network at the entry node - traffic encrypted
* Passed to middle node - traffic encrypted
* Exit node - traffic encrypted
* Bob's ISP
* Bob

*Only encrypting traffic. Should encrypt message before sending into network*

Tor browser bundle - based on Firefox

Tor doesn't know who the volunteers are. Could be bad actors - no way to tell. Anyone can become a relay - page detailing the risks, what it means. Exit nodes funnel trafic out and are first point of contact for law enforcement.
