### How the internet watches you

**Email**

* Send an email, encoded as packets with metadata
* Goes through local router
* Sends it into the ISP's "last mile" network
* ISP sends it to a part of the internet backbone, built of optical fibre - NSA
* After bouncing around sent to another ISP's "last mile"
* Handed off to mail server

**Who can see what after your email leaves your computer**

*The ISP*

* Local router: wired or wifi router at home or company, coffee shop, hotel etc - normally provided by ISP
* Local router can always see address of site you are visiting (eg gmail), header info on the email and sometimes the content of the email itself
* Header information: metadata - think of your email message as a postcard that anyone can read
* Contains address of recipient, sender, time it was sent and IP address (which can be geocoded)

*Every backbone provider along the way*

* This includes anyone they decide (or are forced) to share that information with

*Email server*
