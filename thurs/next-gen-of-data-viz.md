# The next generation of data viz

By Alberto Cairo

**Examples given:**

* <http://graphtv.kevinformatics.com>

* <http://visualisingbuffy.com> - how much time each character spends on screen, done entirely in d3

**When we talk about the future of visualisation, we focus too much on the technical aspects. Other tools are available:**

* graphly
* plotly
* cartodb

**Future of visualisation doesn't depend on the tools we use, but on solid principles. Predictions/wishes:**

* designers and journalists should become better at using numbers and evidence - not just data journalists
* data journalists and infographic/visualisation designers can lead the way and help raise numeracy and visual skills of their colleagues and the public
* should point out when things are wrong
* need skills to spot bad visualisations
* misuse of data - absolute numbers - divide the total number of deaths by number of cars, deaths per 100,000 vehicles
* critiques are extremely important but don't be unkind
* interrogate the data - check margin of error, number/variable in isolation means nothing. Put it in context
* data journalists and visualisation designers are victims of 'patternicity' - finding meaningful patterns in meaningless noise, jumping to conclusions based on preconcieved ideas

**"The first principle in journalism is that you must not fool yourself -- and you are the easiest person to fool"** - Richard Feynman

**Ukraine map** - <http://texty.org.ua>

* Ukraine is a divided country. Cities in which unrest is reported all in the west. Split between east and west is an OVERSIMPLIFICATION. The picture is much more nuanced and data being hidden in current reporting of the Ukrainian situation. 
* Over interpreting patterns - story is much more complicated than major news orgs maps would have you believe.

**John Snow map - proved connection between cholera and drinking contaminated water**

* didn't just pay attention to the data that confirmed his hypothesis
* Also looked at the data that could potentially disprove his idea eg. people drinking water on their way to work, or people with private wells in areas of high death rate

**Prediction two: A return to the foundation of visualisation**

* At the moment, there is a lot of noise

*Five features:*

* Truthful
* Functional - what do you want your reader to do with the data? What graphic form should you use? 
* Beautiful - attracting and appealing to audience. Basics of graphic design mandatory for undergrads
* Insightful - should reveal things that are important/interesting. Should help readers understand the data, not just data dumps. Layer the graphic in a way that most important facts shown first, then the rest of the information follows
* Enlightening - reveal something the reader didn't know before

**To many designers focus on the beautiful, but forget the other features**

* Mike Monteiro - How designers destroyed the world <http://t.co.Kfegq3ldj6>
* William Playfair - the great innovator - imports and exports to and from North America
* Avoid assuming readers will not understand the graphic, don't fear innovation but be skeptical
* Washington Post graphic - are the winter olympics for the rich? Difficult to extract pattern and compare. Bouncing bubbles are a distraction
* AC thinks should be organised as a bar chart at the end - another tool for understanding the data better, accessing the complexity of the data

**Prediction three: Designers and journalists will encode their data more than once**

* Multi-dimensionality of the data
* eg. NYT - how American's spend their day graphic. Stage one gives you an overview, stage two comes when you click on any of the categories
* Multiple representation for multiple functions eg. map then table
* University of Wisconsin - cartography students: <http://50yearsofchange.com>

**Prediction four: Designers will learn that writing is as important to visualisation as the visuals and graphics themselves**

* Language Communities of Twitter by Eric Fischer - not particularly insightful because no annotation. Not pointing out the exceptions
* Editorial voice is very important, higlighting what is important in the data
* In some cases, graphics that are most important are the simplest eg. NYT where does breast cancer kill - tells you something in stages. Clear and close relationship between graphic and text

**Prediction five: Data driven motion graphics will be everywhere**

* Robert B Reich: Inequality for All
* Hans Rosling: <http://www.gapminder.org> 

**Prediction six: News visualisation designers will assume thst becoming proficient in using technologies is not a goal in itself**

* You must be a creator of devices that make the earth a better place before you can even think of becoming a fine artist
