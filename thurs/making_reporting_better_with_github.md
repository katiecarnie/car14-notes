### Making reporting better with Github

@BenBalter - government@github.com

Git and github fundamentals tomorrow at 11am (?)

Advanced github on Saturday at 1pm (?)

#### Detailing the process

**Old ways of working - uncollaborative**

* Content shared as late as possible
* You had to be there in order to collaborate - smoke-filled back rooms
* Doesn't capture process, only captures the final outcome

**Open source now a decentralised model**

* Software can live on without me
* More collaboration, less friction - easier for other people to contribute to whatever you are working on
* Open Source (eg. Britannica vs Wikipedia)

**How to work in an open-source way**

* Electronic - discussion, planning and operations, high fidelity form of electronic communication eg. email, github or chat with transcripts
* Work should be visible, expose process, have a URL, describe how the decision came to pass
* Make everything asyncronous
* Lock free - avoid creating systemic blockers. Working toward shared goals shouldn't require approval
* Non-adversarial

**Build an ecosystem around a project**

* Task list or bug tracker
* Communicate the big picture - set a vision of reality eg Obama campaign 2008
* What is your vision/goal
* Encourage contribution but detail how to contribute


#### Git

* Version control system, decentralised
* Tracks who made change when
* Command line

**Repositories**

* Essentially a project folder, most basic element of GitHub
* Can have multiple collaborators
* Clone (noun) - initial pull request: taking code that exists on a shared server, pull it down to your own machine
* Commits - individual change to a file. Uniquely identifiable by the hash. Tells you who made the change (diff) when it was made etc
* Branches - parallel versions of the same repo eg Back to the Future, going back to a parallel 1985. Don't upset original version. Can then be merged back in

**Github** - social network for git

* Users: personal to individual
* Organisations: group many users together, are administered by users, can own repositories
* Issues: suggested improvements, tasks. Created by users, closed by admins
* Forks: personal copy of another user's repository which then lives as a repository in your own account. Can make changes without affecting the original, can be public or private. Used to submit a *pull request*
* Feedback repos
