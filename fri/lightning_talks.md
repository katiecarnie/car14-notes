####Refactoring - why your code sucks and how to fix it
**@onyxfish**

*"Code read and modified much more quickly than written"*
 
What is refactoring? - improving code quality without adding features
 
 **Follow the code smells:**
 
 1. Duplicated code - if it's there twice it's wrong
 2. Loooong functions 
 3. Inconsistent style - don't copy and paste!
 
Develop good habits by refactoring, otherwise your code is like word clouds - bad!

#### What can we learn from terrible data viz
**@katiepark**

* Not everything needs a chart!
