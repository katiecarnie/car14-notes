### Maps with leaflet and mapbox

1. Get data from Texas open data site. Add FIPS number

2. Open shapefile in qgis

3. For all of your columns tell qgis your relevant columns are strings then save as a csvt - save in same folder:

		eg. "String","String","String","String","String","String","String","Real","String","String","String"

4. Joins: Join shapefile and data on FIPS number. Now attribute table should show both

5. Save as geojson
