### Holding algorithms accountable

*Print outs of recent Tow Center report upstairs*

**Question of responsibility**

* Correlation does not equal causation
* Correlation does not equal intent (with regard to algoritms - maybe the designer did not intend for this to happen)
* Understanding the design process of building algorithms can help understand why they function in the way they do


**A couple of different ways that journalists can approach algorithms:** 

* Why are they important? (explainers etc)
* Pick apart algorithms and expose flaws - how might 	an algoritm be discriminatory
* Does it break a law? Does it make us feel uneasy? If so should be questioned
